# NI-SystemLink-APIs-Example
we will look at how developing ‘web monitor and control application’ is made easier through NI SystemLink API

# Example: Monitor and Control a simple Temperature Controller
This is the example of a simple temperature controller that turns ON\OFF the heater to keep the temperature within the set point range. The temperature, limits and heater state data from LabVIEW VI is being continuously published to the Web page built using WebVI. I have embedded the quick demo of application through a GIF
